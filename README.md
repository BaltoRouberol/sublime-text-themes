This repository contains my personal SublimeText themes adaptations.

## Installation
To install a theme, copy the `.tmTheme` file into the `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/`
directory. You'll be able to select it through the SublimeText menu (Preferences > Color Scheme > Color Scheme - Default).

## MonokaiClean
Based on Monokai. I removed the italic on functions arguments and storage types, 
added coloration on language argument (ex: `self` and `cls` in Python).
Language constants are colorized in yellow.

Markdown is also supported and colorized by default.
